# WineQuality-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the **Wine Quality Dataset** to understand the relationship between physicochemical properties and wine quality ratings.  
It was developed using **Python** as part of an academic data analysis study.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  

---

## Project Overview
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and checked data consistency.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Used descriptive statistics and visualizations (heatmaps, histograms, boxplots).  
3. **Correlation Analysis:** Examined relationships between chemical features and wine quality scores.  
4. **Visualization:** Displayed patterns and distributions to identify the most influential variables.

---

## Insights
- Variables such as **alcohol content**, **volatile acidity**, and **citric acid** were found to have strong correlations with wine quality.  
- The analysis demonstrated how statistical techniques and visualization can improve data-driven understanding.

## Key Learning
This project strengthened my understanding of **data preprocessing**, **statistical analysis**, and **data visualization** in Python.  
It also improved my ability to interpret quantitative results and present findings clearly.
